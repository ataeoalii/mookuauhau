NOTE: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/sandbox/ Apollo studio sandbox allows you to craft GraphQL queries against your API.

In addition to this API, the [Neo4J GraphQL library](https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/) also needs to be installed in order to query a Neo4J instance and add additional relationship metadata to the GraphQL types and queries.
